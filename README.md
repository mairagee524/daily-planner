# daily-planner

In this application, the user will be able to organize his/her/their work schedule by adding events to each hourblock. 

The hourblock is a `textarea` where the user will be able to save it using the button to the right.

There are three colors to represent the past, present, and future. 

Note - this is a work in progress. To make this application fully functional, I need to add/modify code on local storage.
