# daily-planner

In this application, the user will be able to organize his/her/their work schedule by adding events to each hourblock. 

The hourblock in the center of each row is a `textarea` where the user will be able to type in any event or task the user wants to do for that hour. After, the user will be able to save the task/event using the `save` button. 

There are three colors in the hourblock to show if the hour is in the past, present, or future. 

 - if the hour is in the past, the `textarea` block will be chocolate brown

 - if the hour is in the present, the `textarea` block will be sky blue

 - if the hour is in the future, the `textarea` block will be light green

The user will also be able to change the event  if there is already another event in that textbox. Should a user do so, he/she/they must remember to click on the `save` button.
